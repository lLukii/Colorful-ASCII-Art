# Colorful ASCII Art (WIP)
Converts an image into ASCII art such that it is color coded in a way that resembles the original image. <br/>

# How to run: 
You can choose to run the *gen.py* file to generate an ASCII image or *video.py* file to generate an ASCII version of whatever video/image you specified. <br/>
Note: You do need to download .mp4 files from the internet in order for the program to process the file although we are currently working on integrating youtube-dl <br/>
to automate the download process. <br/>
Because the current version of video.py processes frames in quadratic time, it is recommended that you set the width size to be at most 170 so that the video <br/>
can keep up with the audio. These numbers may vary however depending on your CPU specs and video framerate.
